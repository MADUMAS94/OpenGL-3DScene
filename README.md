# How do I approach designing software? 

for designing software I first think of the requirments. Examples from this class would be the ability to control the camera, the view changes, object requirments (such as how many shapes are needed per object), textures, and lighting. Then I start by splitting the work up based on the design into managable peices, getting that peice to work, then moving onto the next. For this project the first section that was worked on was the camera controls, this meant I made sure that I could move around the scene using the arrow keys, move from ortho to perspective view using O and P keys, and adjust the speed of the camera with the scroll wheel. After that was done I moved onto the next task, which was setting the objects in the world, and so on. By making my design modular I ensured that all requirments were met and working. This tactic can be used in future work to ensure that I meet deadlines for my deliverables, it also helps with debugging as you will be testing with each new addition to the project. \

# How do I approach developing programs? 

For designing programs I start by presenting a design based off the requrments in the software design phase. This would be user stories in most cases, but in this class it would be the requrment from the rubric. I will then get approval for the design and start weaving that into the software so that visually the program is what the client has requested - in this class it would be the image of my selected objects. In programs user feedback is the best way to ensure your software is working as intended, so leaving that open even after the first iteration of the program will allow for changes to be made down the line. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

computer science is a very broad term that covers many topics. Being familliar in the topics it covers though will allow me to build new skills that are marketable across the industry. My goal is to be a software developer, and being familliar with many topics will assist me with that as many positions require a fullstack set of skills.
